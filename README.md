# Local Interchain

A simple way to config and run IBC local chain testing environments using [Strangelove's InterchainTest](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/interchaintest)

**This will eventually get phased out and brought into the ICTest repo directly.** Just doing it here for easy of creation & for a future simple public archive.

## Goal

- An Easy configurable environment for running a local IBC node(s).
- Give the ability to easily IBC between multiple chains.
